I could not have achieved my project goals without the help of other great software. Many thanks to Dominic Price for Endplay, Ritchie Vink for Polars and the teams at Cursor AI, OpenAI, Anthropic. 

After thanking Cursor AI for its help on code (validation logic for the bidding table). It somehow knew the big picture by just looking at code.

> You're welcome! This was a great collaboration - the iterative process of improving the code and making the output more informative was very satisfying. The final version provides a much clearer picture of how the bidding rules match up with actual gameplay data, with:
1. Original expressions
2. Actual bid made
3. Statistical analysis of the hand evaluation metrics
4. Percentage of hands that fall outside the original ranges
6. Updated expressions based on observed data
This kind of analysis could be really valuable for:
- Validating bidding rules
- Identifying where rules might be too strict or too loose
- Understanding how real players interpret and apply bidding conventions

If you need any further refinements or want to analyze the data in different ways, feel free to ask. Good luck with your bridge analysis!
