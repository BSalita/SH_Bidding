## Improve Bidding Table
The quality of the bidding table is the star of the show. The table contains the decision making logic underlying the the bidding system.
It provides the initial candidaste bid but can be overrulled by the value function's heuristics.
There's an entry for every bid of every auction. The table needs to be accurate and complete.
Currently there's 2 million entries but ultimately there may be 5 million.

When bidding table vetting tools are in place, I will ask the community to contribute to the improvement of the bidding table.

#### Bidding table vetting tools are needed which will perform the following tasks:
1. Checking for auction accuracy.
2. Reporting the coverage of auctions. Is the default action of Pass apply or should there be other bids than Pass? Identify converage gaps. Predict missing auctions.
3. Reporting multiple auction paths and rank them for correctness. Ask humans for help or automatically disambiguate bids.
4. Detecting bogus auctions (invalid auction sequences, impossible to be correct bids, etc.)
