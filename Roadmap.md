## Roadmap for Superhuman Bidding in Contract Bridge

### Improve Bidding Table
The quality of the bidding table is central to the project's success. This table contains the decision-making logic underlying the bidding system. It provides the initial candidate bid, which can be overruled by the value function's heuristics. The table includes an entry for every bid of every auction and must be both accurate and complete. Currently, there are 2 million entries, but this may expand to 5 million entries as the project evolves.

Once the bidding table vetting tools are in place, the community will be invited to contribute to its improvement through submission, validation, and integration processes.

### Bidding Table Vetting Tools
These tools will be essential for ensuring the bidding table's accuracy and completeness. They will perform the following tasks:

1. **Checking for Auction Accuracy**
   - Validate auction sequences based on historical data, expert strategies, and logical consistency.
   - Highlight discrepancies and suggest corrections for inaccurate bids.

2. **Reporting the Coverage of Auctions**
   - Analyze the coverage of different auction scenarios, identifying gaps where default actions (like Pass) may not be appropriate.
   - Predict missing auctions and suggest new entries for the table.

3. **Reporting Multiple Auction Paths**
   - Identify and rank multiple possible auction paths for correctness based on expert heuristics or AI-driven predictions.
   - Engage human experts for ambiguous scenarios or automatically disambiguate bids using predefined rules.

4. **Detecting Bogus Auctions**
   - Identify invalid auction sequences and bids that are impossible to be correct using rule-based validation or simulations.
   - Report and correct errors in the bidding table.

### Community Engagement
Once the vetting tools are operational, community contributions will play a pivotal role. A well-defined process will be established to:
   - Allow members to submit new or revised entries for the bidding table.
   - Review and validate submissions for accuracy and consistency.
   - Integrate approved contributions into the system, ensuring a seamless update process.

### Timeline and Milestones
1. **Phase 1**: Develop and test bidding table vetting tools. Target completion: [Insert date].
2. **Phase 2**: Launch community contribution platform and guidelines. Target completion: [Insert date].
3. **Phase 3**: Achieve 90% auction coverage with accurate and validated entries. Target completion: [Insert date].

### Performance Metrics
To evaluate progress, the following KPIs will be tracked:
   - Percentage improvement in auction coverage.
   - Reduction in errors or inconsistencies in the bidding table.
   - Number of community-contributed and validated entries integrated.

By adhering to this roadmap, we aim to create a robust, superhuman-level bidding system that sets a new standard in contract bridge strategy.
